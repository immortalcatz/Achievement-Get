# Achievement-Get
A game of achievements

This is a mod aimed towards creative server admins to create their own stat-based achievements.

Use of this mod on the client is **not** required, but is recommended, as it adds the achievement page and notification
for when the player gains the achievement. Everyone, whether they have the mod or not, will see when somebody else
gains an achievement through chat.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/killjoy1221/Achievement-Get/wiki/Config) for info about creating achievements.
